# Stock Exchange Simulation Website

Investing in the stock market can be intimidating, especially for beginners. This Stock Exchange Simulation platform provides a realistic trading experience using live market dataâ€”allowing users to buy, sell, and manage a virtual portfolio without any financial risk.

## Overview

This project simulates a stock exchange environment where users can:
- **Practice trading** using real-time stock market data.
- **Track portfolio performance** with live updating prices.
- **View transaction history** to analyze past trades.
- **Manage account balance** by adding or withdrawing virtual funds.
- **Monitor performance** with metrics for overall profit/loss since account creation and profit/loss for the current day.

In addition to the stock simulation, the proposal includes additional ideas (like weather-based outfit recommendation and a recipe generator), but this repository focuses on the stock exchange simulation.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up, login, and secure routes using JWT.
- **Real-Time Trading:** Buy and sell stocks with live market data.
- **Portfolio Management:** View current holdings and adjust your portfolio.
- **Transaction History:** See a detailed log of all your buy/sell transactions.
- **Account Balance:** Track your virtual funds and update them as needed.
- **Performance Tracking:** View overall performance (profit/loss since opening account) and today's performance.
- **Live Price Updates:** Trending stocks update live, and clicking a stock shows a live updating chart of its price history.
